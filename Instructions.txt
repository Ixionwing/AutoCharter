1. Import the project into Eclipse

>>> If Eclipse cannot find the requisite .jar files, simply go to Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Add JARs, and add jl1.0.1 and TarsosDSP-latest.

2. Run

3. Follow the on-screen prompts

>>> You will first be prompted for basic information about the Be-Music Script file you're about to create. This includes:
	1. The file name (excluding the extension), 
	2. The proposed genre of the song,
	3. The proposed title of the song,
	4. The proposed composer of the song,
	5. The song's BPM (NOTE: IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU KNOW THE EXACT BPM FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK PROPERLY), and
	6. The notechart's tentative level (beatmania's scale is 1-12; mind that this does not affect how notes are placed, but is rather only intended to help form the file's skeleton)

>>> Afterward, you will be prompted to enter up to 35 audio files. It is highly recommended that these audio files be separated by instrument; that is, you should either have made the track, or have the multi-track available from the track's author.
>>> It is also highly recommended that you enter all files that have to do with percussion first. After doing so, enter "p" alone to notify the program that all percussion files have been loaded, and will subsequently tag all further files as harmonic.
>>> To cease file input early, simply enter 0.

4. Wait until extraction is finished

5a. Copy the resultant notechart (the .bme file) and all generated keysounds (01-ZZ.wav) into a folder within the beatmania simulator of your choice. I personally recommend LunaticRave 2; installation and usage instructions are available here: http://news.keysounds.net/lr2guide

5b. Edit the notechart to your liking using BMSE, available here: https://github.com/dtinth/UCN-BMSE

6. Enjoy!
